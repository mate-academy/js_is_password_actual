# sQA: Is password actual ([uk](readme.uk.md))

Write tests for the `isPasswordActual` function. This function:

- takes three numbers: `year` - year, `month` - month, `date` - the date when the password was last updated;
- converts the received numbers into a date and checks how many days have passed since that date;
- returns a message about whether to change the password.

If 30 days or less have passed since the last password change, the function returns the message `Password is actual.`.  
If more than 30 days have passed since the last password change, the function returns the message `You should change your password.`.  
If more than 60 days have passed since the last password change, the function returns the message `Immediately change the password!`.

Examples (let it be Jun 10, 2021 for today):

```js
isPasswordActual(2020, 6, 9) === `Immediately change the password!`
isPasswordActual(2021, 6, 1) === `Password is actual.`
isPasswordActual(2021, 5, 1) === `You should change your password.`
```
